# Rainwater Harvesting Potential Estimator
# Overview

Water scarcity is a pressing issue in many regions, and individuals or communities often lack awareness of how much rainwater they can realistically collect based on their location, rooftop size, and rainfall patterns. Without accurate estimations, people may either overinvest in unnecessarily large systems or underestimate the benefits of harvesting rainwater.

This tool helps bridge that gap by providing personalized, data-driven calculations for rainwater harvesting potential. Users can estimate their harvested water, seasonal distribution, potential water loss, and water savings for multiple households. Additionally, it raises awareness with random water conservation quotes.

**Features**

Calculate rainwater harvested per 1 m² based on rooftop area, district rainfall, and runoff coefficient.

Compare current rainfall vs average rainfall.

Show seasonal rainwater distribution with a bar chart.

Calculate total water harvested, previously collected water, and potential water loss for multiple households.

Estimate potential water savings for gardening, toilet flushing, and washing.

Display random awareness quotes to promote water conservation.

**Example Output**

Average Rainfall in LOHIT: 3043.8 mm/year

Estimated Rainwater Harvested per 1 m²: 2435.04 liters/year

Previously Collected Water per 1 m²: 487.01 liters/year

Potential Water Loss per 1 m²: 1948.03 liters/year

Seasonal Rainwater Harvested (per 1 m²):

Jan-Feb: 98.40 liters

Mar-May: 673.04 liters

Jun-Sep: 1478.80 liters

Oct-Dec: 184.80 liters

Monsoon period: Jun-Sep

Potential Water Savings for 7 households:

Gardening: 5681.76 liters/year

Toilet Flushing: 5681.76 liters/year

Washing: 5681.76 liters/year

**Awareness Quote:**
Rainwater is precious - harvest it wisely.
